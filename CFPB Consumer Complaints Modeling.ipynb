    "# CFPB Consumer Complaints Modeling  \n",
    "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a U.S. government agency that makes sure financial companies treat their customers fairly. Their website allows customers of financial services to file complaints against financial companies and banks against unfair treatment if these companies are unable to resolve complaints to the customer’s satisfaction. On receipt, the CFPB routes complaints to the financial companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create the model that can help the banks identify complaints that will end in a dispute. The goal is to minimize total financial costs, and if the banks can identify future disputes they can avoid the larger costs by performing the cheaper extra diligence in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost structure:\n",
    "On average, it costs the banks \\\\$100 to resolve, respond to and close a complaint that is not disputed. On the other hand, it costs banks an extra \\\\$500 to resolve a complaint if it has been disputed. \n",
    "Extra diligence: If the banks know in advance which complaints will be disputed, they can perform “extra diligence” during the first round of addressing the complaint with a view to avoiding eventual disputes.  Performing extra diligence costs $90 per complaint, and provides a guarantee that the customer will not dispute the complaint.  But performing the extra diligence is wasted money if the customer would not have disputed the complaint.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will use only the data till 2017, and only for the top 5 banks in the US. https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaintsmplaints"
