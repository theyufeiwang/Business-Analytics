    "# NYC 311 Calls\n",
    "This project explores the comprehensive dataset of 311 Service Requests from 2010 to the present, maintained by New York City's open data initiative. The NYC 311 service acts as a vital communication channel between the city's residents and its various non-emergency services, addressing concerns ranging from noise complaints to road maintenance issues. This dataset is publicly available and regularly updated on the [NYC Open Data portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9), complete with a data dictionary that elucidates its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, we delve into the data, which spans up until August 4, 2023, with a particular focus on evaluating the dynamics and trends of the city's non-emergency requests. Our primary objectives in this project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Daily Complaint Patterns**: Calculating the average number of daily complaints received in the year 2022.\n",
    "- **Peak Inquiry Analysis**: Identifying the single date with the maximum number of calls and determining the prevalent complaint types on that day.\n",
    "- **Seasonal Variations and Quietest Periods**: Analyzing monthly call patterns to discover the quietest month historically and performing ETS decomposition to observe seasonal trends on specific dates, such as December 25, 2020.\n",
    "- **Autocorrelation Study**: Examining the relationship between consecutive days' call volumes to understand dependencies and patterns.\n",
    "- **Forecasting**: Utilizing the Prophet library to predict future call volumes and assess the model accuracy with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics for the last 90 days' forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these analyses, this project aims to provide insights into the operational scale of NYC's 311 service and understand the temporal dynamics that could assist city planners and public service providers in optimizing resource allocation and improving service delivery."
